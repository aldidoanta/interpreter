LittleBasic
===========

A toy BASIC-like language implemented using [Antlr4](http://www.antlr.org/) and Java.

It's just an excuse to play with Antlr and language creation. It's small and simple but it has 
most constructs used in structured programming.

### Syntax

Check the grammar file `src/main/antlr4/basic/LittleBasic.g4` and the test files `src/test/resources/*.bas`

Example:
```PureBasic
REM Greatest common divisor
INPUT "A=" ain
INPUT "B=" bin
a = VAL(ain)
b = VAL(bin)

WHILE b > 0
    t = a MOD b
    a = b
    b = t
END

PRINT "GCD=" + a
```
Output:
```
A= 36
B= 27
GCD=9
```

### Building

It's built with Maven, so simply execute this in the project directory:

```
mvn install
```
You'll find the jar in the `/target` directory.

### Running

In the console:

```
java -jar LittleBasic.jar /path/to/MyAwesomeProgram.bas
```

### Limitations/TODO

* Limited data types - only integers and strings
* No functions and subroutines
* Variables have global scope only
* No file I/O
* Only a few built-in functions
* No support for drawing
* No interactive mode 

**Enjoy!**
